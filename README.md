# ðŸ¤¡ jacob frey soundboard ðŸ¤¡

hello.

this a simple soundboard that catalogues some (but not all) of the stupid shit that jacob frey (the mayor of minneapolis) says.

this was built with [react](https://reactjs.org/) and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

huge shoutout to [glitch's new starter apps](https://blog.glitch.com/post/a-closer-look-at-the-new-glitch-starter-apps) for making it super easy to rage-write this in a couple of hours.
